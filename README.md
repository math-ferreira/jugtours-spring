# JugTours Backend

This is the backend project for JugTours, a Java User Groups application. The project was created to follow the tutorial outlined in the blog post [Create a Java REST API with Spring Boot](https://auth0.com/blog/spring-boot-angular-crud/#Create-a-Java-REST-API-with-Spring-Boot) by Auth0. The backend is designed to be used in conjunction with a frontend made in Angular JS.

## Tutorial Source

The primary inspiration for this project comes from the Auth0 blog post, which provides a step-by-step guide on creating a Java REST API using Spring Boot. The tutorial covers the essential aspects of setting up a backend system that can be seamlessly integrated with a frontend application.
